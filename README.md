# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-from-scratch


he test problem we will be using in this tutorial is iris classification.

The problem is comprised of 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species. There are 4 measurements of given flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width, all in the same unit of centimeters. The predicted attribute is the species, which is one of setosa, versicolor or virginica.

# Implementation using Python3:
-Open the dataset from CSV and split into test/train datasets.

-Calculate the distance between two data instances.

-Get the k most similar data instances based on distance.

-Generate a response from a set of data instances.

-Compute the accuracy



# Result:
