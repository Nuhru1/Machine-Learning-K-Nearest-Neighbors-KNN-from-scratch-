# K-Nearest-Neighbors-KNN-from-scratch


he test problem we will be using in this tutorial is iris classification.

The problem is comprised of 150 observations of iris flowers from three different species. There are 4 measurements of given flowers: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width, all in the same unit of centimeters. The predicted attribute is the species, which is one of setosa, versicolor or virginica.
